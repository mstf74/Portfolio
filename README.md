# Backend Engineer  

## ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

Welcome to my portfolio! Iâ€™m Mostafa Abdou Saleh, a passionate software engineer with a strong focus on backend development. From a young age, Iâ€™ve been fascinated by computers and electronics, driven by my love for gaming and curiosity about how things work behind the scenes.

My passion for programming, especially in backend development, grew during college. I gravitated toward ASP.NET and backend frameworks because I enjoy working on the foundation of systems, ensuring everything operates smoothly and efficiently. Whether in software or life, I aim to build solid, reliable solutions. With my skills and mindset, Iâ€™m confident in delivering high-performing solutions you can trust.
